Feature: Add a todo
    Scenario: Add my first todo
        Given I have no todos
        And I navigate to the home page
        And the home page has loaded
        When I submit "An example todo" for my new todo title
        Then I see the following todos:
            | title           | completed |
            | An example todo | false     |
        And I see that I have "1 item left"
